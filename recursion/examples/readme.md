## Factorial
The factorial of a non-negative integer (n) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
It is denoted by the exclamation point symbol `n!`.
Mathematically, the factorial of n is defined as:
`n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 2 * 1`
> Example: 5! (factorial of 5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

### Special Cases
- By convention, 0! (factorial of 0) is defined as 1, since it is the empty product.
- Factorials are not defined for negative integers.
