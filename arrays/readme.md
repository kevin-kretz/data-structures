## Common Uses
- storing lists of data, when the number of items in the list is known.

## Benefits
- Good at retrieving information if you know which index the data is located
- Good if you know the number of items you want to put inside of the list

## Limitations
 - More difficult to add data to the list, once the list is full
   - You can create a new list with more space and move the data from the old list to the new list
   - You can create another array and then link the two arrays together by putting them inside a parent array (making a 2D array)

## Alternatives
[Linked Lists](../linked_lists/readme.md) - If you don't know how many items will be added to the list.
